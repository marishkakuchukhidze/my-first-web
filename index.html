    Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either
    electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
    photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business,
    as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
    communication.

    Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the
    light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an
    electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent
    display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically
    "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material
    and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive
    image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</span>

  <span class="span-two">Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries, relating to seeing an
    image and capturing
    the image. The discovery of the camera obscura ("dark chamber" in Latin) that provides an image of a scene dates
    back to ancient China. Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the 5th
    and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera
    obscura in his experiments.

    The Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) also invented a camera obscura as well as the first true
    pinhole camera. The invention of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham. While the effects of
    a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier, Ibn al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis
    of the camera obscura, including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon, and was the
    first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could be projected onto
    a screen on the other side. He also first understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole, and
    performed early experiments with afterimages, laying the foundations for the invention of photography in the 19th
    century.</span>

    <h1>BLACK-WHITE</h1>

  <div class="box">

  </div>


  <span class="span-one">Originally, all photography was monochrome, or black-and-white. Even after color film was
    readily available,
    black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost, chemical stability, and its
    "classic" photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white
    photography.[39] Monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades
    of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The cyanotype process, for example,
    produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen print process, publicly revealed in 1847, produces brownish
    tones.

    Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival
    permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a
    variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that
    exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs
    taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or
    single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated,
    monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to
    shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to
    produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.</span>

    <img src="./pictures/mm3.jpg">

    <span class="film">The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate, photographic film or a silicon
      electronic image sensor is the capture medium.
      The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.

      Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording material to the required amount of light
      to form a "latent image" (on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing,
      is converted to a usable image. Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive
      electronics such as charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The
      resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.

      The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded
      except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject
      being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is
      kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common
      for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see Process camera).

      As soon as photographic materials became "fast" (sensitive) enough for taking candid or surreptitious pictures,
      small "detective" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the Ticka
      camera) or even worn hidden behind an Ascot necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.

      The movie camera is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium.
      In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of
      images, each called a "frame". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played
      back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the "frame rate" (number of frames per second). While
      viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion</span>

  <span class="bird">During the 20th century, both fine art photography and documentary photography became accepted by
    the English-speaking art world and the gallery system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including
    Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, John Szarkowski, F. Holland Day, and Edward Weston, spent their lives advocating
    for photography as a fine art. At first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is
    called Pictorialism, often using soft focus for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, Ansel Adams,
    and others formed the Group f/64 to advocate 'straight photography', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in
    itself and not an imitation of something else.

    The aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles.
    Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically
    art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a
    photograph makes it beautiful to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images "written with light";
    Nicéphore Niépce, Louis Daguerre, and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some
    questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.

    Clive Bell in his classic essay Art states that only "significant form" can distinguish art from what is not
    art.</span>

    <span class="bird-one">The experimental film Roundhay Garden Scene, filmed by Louis Le Prince on October 14, 1888 in
      Roundhay, Leeds, England, is the earliest surviving motion picture. This movie was shot on paper film.

      An experimental film camera was developed by British inventor William Friese Greene and patented in 1889.W. K. L.
      Dickson, working under the direction of Thomas Alva Edison, was the first to design a successful apparatus, the
      Kinetograph, patented in 1891.This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak
      photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent celluloid strip 35 mm wide. The results of this work were first
      shown in public in 1893, using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the Kinetoscope. Contained within a
      large box, only one person at a time looking into it through a peephole could view the movie.

      In the following year, Charles Francis Jenkins and his projector, the Phantoscope, made a successful audience
      viewing while Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, an apparatus that took, printed, and
      projected film, in Paris in December 1895. The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving,
      photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.

      In 1896, movie theaters were open in France (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille); Italy (Rome, Milan, Naples,
      Genoa, Venice, Bologna, Forlì); Brussels; and London. The chronological improvements in the medium may be listed
      concisely. In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in
      the U.S. Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in
      1905. The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906. Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures
      in 1911. The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make close-ups without
      physically moving the camera. By the late 1920s, most of the movies produced were sound films. Wide screen formats
      were first experimented within the 1950s. By the 1970s, most movies were color films. IMAX and other 70mm formats
      gained popularity. Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for "blockbusters." Film
      cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s when digital
      cinematography became dominant. Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific
      applications or out of fondness for the format</span>
